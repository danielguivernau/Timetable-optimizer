# Timetable-optimizer
I want to create a program that given a set of worker and time constraints solves the integer optimization problem of the schedule that maximizes worker preferences within those constrains 

## Setup
I believe that after much work (lol) I've finally been able to set up a python enviorment and the requirement files for this project.
